\title{Kirill's miscellaneous functions}
\description{
A collection of useful functions not found anywhere else, mainly
for programming: Generalized lagged differences, checking containment in an
interval, creating a factor where the levels maintain the order of appearance,
sampling rows from a data frame, converting seconds from midnight to and from
H:M:S format, choosing the first non-NA value, transposing lists of lists,
returning the name of the file currently sourced, smart named lists and
vectors, and an alternative interface to assign().
